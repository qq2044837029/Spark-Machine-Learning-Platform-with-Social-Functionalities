# Spark & Machine Learning Platform with Social Functionalities

### Author: 

Haoqiu Wu

### Brief Introduction

This system is developed on Linux system, aiming at providing our CRN lab with a Spark & Machine Learning Model Deployment Platform with Social Functionalities.
In terms of ML platform, there are three functionalities so far:
* Real-time Prediction with Spark for Movement Data from Sensor.
* Prediction for uploaded Movement Data.
* An Entertaiment Chatbot.

In terms of socal funtionalities, this system has four modules:
* Account Module
* Article Module
* Image Module
* Admin Module

### Techniques Used in this System: 

* Keras for RNN Model.
* Spark Streaming for Real-time Process for Sensor Data.
* Sklearn and NLTK for Chatbot by Word-Embedding and Cosine-Similarity.
* Python Django for Backend.
* Haystack-whoosh for Full Text Search.
* Bootstrap and Vue.js and AJAX for Frontend.
* MySQL, Redis, MongoDB for Data Storage.
